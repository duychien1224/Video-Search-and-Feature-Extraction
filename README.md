# Video-Search-and-Feature-Extraction
• Extracted video features in form of color histograms, Scalar-invariant feature transform (SIFT) vectors, and motion vectors. 
• Implemented various distance and similarity functions, dimensionality reduction, and k-most similar subsequences search for videos using Matlab and Python libraries. 
• Implemented personalized PageRank and ASCOD measures to retrieve most relevant frames from a video database along with locality sensitive hashing for nearest neighbor in high dimensions.
